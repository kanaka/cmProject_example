This is an example of using cmProject and auto.mk together.

First clone the example repository:

    git clone https://github.com/kanaka/cmProject_example

The first time after you clone a cmProject based project repository,
you need to bootstrap by manually populating the cmProject directory.

    cd cmProject_example
    git clone https://github.com/kanaka/cmProject

Now you can populate the project:

    make pop

To show cmProject help:

    make help^cmProject

To show auto.mk help

    make help^auto.mk
